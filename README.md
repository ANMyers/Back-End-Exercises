# Back-End-Exercises
Back end exercises done in python and django.

Each directory beginning with a number represents a different exercise from [bangazon-llc](https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-llc/tree/master/orientation/exercises)

Other folders are either code alongs or testing files I personally created.
